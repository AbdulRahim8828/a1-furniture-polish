## Understanding Different Types of Wood Finishes

Before you choose a polish, it's important to identify the finish on your furniture. Most modern furniture has a hard, durable finish like polyurethane, varnish, or lacquer. Older, antique pieces might have a softer oil or shellac finish.

- **Surface Finishes (Polyurethane, Varnish, Lacquer):** These sit on top of the wood. They are durable and water-resistant. You should use a cleaning polish on these, not an oil.
- **Penetrating Finishes (Tung Oil, Linseed Oil):** These soak into the wood. They require periodic re-oiling to prevent the wood from drying out.

**Pro Tip:** To test your finish, place a drop of water on an inconspicuous spot. If it beads up, you have a hard surface finish. If it soaks in, you have an oil finish.

## Types of Wood Polish

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the most common types of polish you'll find.

### 1. Cleaning Polishes (Emulsion Polishes)
These are the most common types of polishes available in sprays or liquids. They are a mix of oils, solvents, and surfactants.

- **Best for:** Furniture with a hard, modern finish (polyurethane, varnish, lacquer).
- **Pros:** Excellent for cleaning away dust, fingerprints, and grime. They are easy to apply and leave a nice shine.
- **Cons:** Can leave a buildup over time if not used sparingly. Look for silicone-free options to avoid a hazy film.

### 2. Oil-Based Polishes
These are typically made from linseed oil, tung oil, or lemon oil.

- **Best for:** Unfinished or oil-finished wood. They are great for nourishing wood and restoring its natural luster.
- **Pros:** Penetrate the wood to prevent it from drying and cracking. Gives a deep, rich glow.
- **Cons:** Should **not** be used on furniture with a hard finish, as the oil won't penetrate and will leave a greasy, dust-attracting layer.

### 3. Wax Polishes
Available in paste or liquid form, wax provides a hard, durable, and long-lasting protective layer.

- **Best for:** All wood types, especially antiques. It offers excellent protection.
- **Pros:** Creates a beautiful, low-sheen luster and protects against spills and scratches.
- **Cons:** Requires more effort to apply. It needs to be buffed well and should only be applied once or twice a year. Over-application can lead to a cloudy buildup.

## What to Avoid

- **Silicone:** Many popular spray polishes contain silicone. While it creates a glossy, slick surface, it can build up and make future refinishing difficult.
- **High-Alkaline Cleaners:** Never use all-purpose kitchen cleaners or ammonia-based products on your wood furniture. They can strip the finish.
- **Too Much Product:** More is not better. Using too much polish of any kind will result in a sticky, dulling buildup.
