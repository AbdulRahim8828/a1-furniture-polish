Polishing furniture seems straightforward, but a few common mistakes can ruin the finish, leaving it dull, sticky, or even damaged. At A1 Furniture Polish, we've seen it all. Here are five of the most common mistakes to avoid to ensure you get a beautiful, professional-looking result every time.

### Mistake 1: Using the Wrong Type of Polish

This is the most frequent error. People often grab a generic polish spray for all their wooden furniture, but not all polishes are created equal. As we covered in our [guide to choosing the right polish](/blog/choosing-the-right-wood-polish), using an oil-based polish on a lacquered surface will create a greasy mess, while a cleaning polish won’t nourish a dry, oil-finished piece.

**How to Avoid It:**
- **Identify your finish.** Is it a hard, sealed finish (like polyurethane) or a softer, penetrating oil finish?
- **Choose a polish that matches the finish.** Use cleaning polishes for sealed surfaces and oil polishes for oil-finished wood.

### Mistake 2: Applying Too Much Polish

More is not better. Over-applying polish, especially sprays and waxes, doesn’t make furniture shinier. Instead, it creates a sticky, dull film that attracts dust and fingerprints. This buildup can be difficult to remove and can obscure the natural beauty of the wood.

**How to Avoid It:**
- **Apply sparingly.** A little goes a long way.
- **Spray the polish onto your cloth,** not directly onto the furniture. This gives you more control.
- **Buff thoroughly** with a clean, dry cloth to remove any excess product.

### Mistake 3: Not Cleaning the Surface First

Polishing a dirty or dusty surface is like waxing a dirty car. You’re just trapping the dirt under a layer of polish. This can create a cloudy, streaky finish and can even cause fine scratches as you rub the abrasive dust particles into the wood.

**How to Avoid It:**
- **Always dust first.** Use a soft, dry microfiber cloth to remove all dust and loose debris before you start polishing.
- For grimy furniture, wipe it down with a slightly damp cloth and dry it completely before applying polish.

### Mistake 4: Using a Dirty or Abrasive Cloth

The cloth you use is just as important as the polish itself. A dirty cloth will just spread grime around, while an abrasive one can scratch the finish.

**How to Avoid It:**
- **Use a clean, soft, lint-free cloth.** Microfiber is an excellent choice.
- **Use separate cloths:** one for applying the polish and another clean one for buffing.
- **Never use old t-shirts or dish towels,** as their fibers can be abrasive.

### Mistake 5: Polishing Too Frequently

Modern furniture finishes are very durable and do not need to be polished very often. Polishing every week is unnecessary and will lead to the dreaded buildup we’ve mentioned. For most sealed finishes, a simple dusting is all that’s needed for weekly maintenance.

**How to Avoid It:**
- **Dust regularly.** This is the most important part of furniture care.
- **Polish only when needed.** For most modern furniture, polishing once every few months is plenty. For antiques with a wax finish, once or twice a year is sufficient.
